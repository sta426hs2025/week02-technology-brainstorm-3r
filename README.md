# Electrophysiology – Patch-Clamp

**Patch-clamp electrophysiology** is a laboratory technique used to measure the electrical properties of individual cells, especially excitable ones like neurons, muscle cells, or immune cells.  

- Developed by **Erwin Neher** and **Bert Sakmann** in the late 1970s, perfected in the 1980s.  
- Earned them the **1991 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine**.  
- Revolutionized neuroscience and cell biology by allowing scientists to observe the function of **single ion channels** in real-time with extremely high resolution.  

Predicated on Ohm’s law, this approach facilitates exploration of ionic conductances, gating mechanisms of ion channels and receptors, and their roles in neuronal, muscular, and cardiac excitability.

### 1. Patch pipette
- A glass micropipette filled with pipette solution (electrolyte similar to the cytosol) is brought into contact with the cell membrane.  
- A tight seal (**“gigaohm seal” – GΩ seal**) forms between the pipette tip and a tiny patch of cell membrane.  

---

### 2. Ion movement
- Ions (shown as **x⁺**) move through ion channels in the cell membrane.  
- These ionic currents flow into the pipette solution and travel up through the pipette.  

---

### 3. Electrode
- Inside the pipette, a **metal electrode** (often silver/silver chloride wire) detects this movement of charge.  
- The electrode converts the ionic current into an electrical signal that can be amplified and measured.  
- Allows highly sensitive measurements of currents as small as **picoamperes (10⁻¹² A)**.  

---

### 4. Amplifier system
- The signal is fed into an **operational amplifier**, compared to a reference (“earth” ground).  
- A **feedback resistor** translates tiny picoampere currents into measurable voltage signals.  
- The amplifier allows experimenters to apply:  
  - **Voltage clamp:** hold membrane potential constant, measure ionic currents.  
  - **Current clamp:** inject current, measure resulting voltage changes.  

---

### 5. Output
- The amplifier outputs a signal representing the ionic current through the membrane patch.  
- On a computer, this appears as:  
  - **Single-channel activity:** tiny, step-like traces of channel openings/closings.  
  - **Whole-cell currents:** summed activity of all ion channels in the cell membrane.

The versatility of patch-clamp comes from the different **configurations** after the initial seal formation.  

### **Cell-Attached (On-Cell)**
- **What it is:** The initial configuration after forming the gigaohm seal. The pipette is attached, membrane under the tip remains intact.  
- **What it measures:** Records single-channel activity in a patch without disrupting the cytoplasm.  

---

### **Whole-Cell**
- **What it is:** After cell-attached, gentle suction ruptures the patch, giving access to the entire cytoplasm.  
- **What it measures:** Records the summed activity of all ion channels across the cell membrane.  
- Common for **action potential studies**.  

---

### **Inside-Out**
- **What it is:** After cell-attached, the pipette is withdrawn, pulling a patch away with the **cytoplasmic side facing the bath**.  
- **What it measures:** Effects of intracellular messengers (e.g., Ca²⁺, cAMP) on ion channel activity.  

---

### **Outside-Out**
- **What it is:** After whole-cell, the pipette is slowly withdrawn; the patch reseals with the **extracellular side facing the bath**.  
- **What it measures:** Effects of extracellular ligands (e.g., neurotransmitters, drugs) on ion channels.
